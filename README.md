# InfiniTiler
InfiniTiler is a game made for a school project I had at the end of the year. <br>
This game is pretty bare bones with only 2 files needed. <br>
## Background
At first, InfiniTiler was going to be my tile editor for my multiplayer game I was going to make instead of InfiniTiler <br>
However, making a multiplayer takes a lot of time. Thankfully, I was able to recycle my tile editor to be a game.
## Goal of the game
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible <br>
You have limited tiles to work with and your placed tiles will disapear after 8 seconds. <br>
You need to get more powerups to increase the amount of tiles you have. <br>
If the dissapearing tiles catch up to you, you die and the game crashes (intentionaly) <br>
If you have a terminal open, you can see how long you played for becaus I forgot to remove the debug timer and im too lazy to fix that. <br>
# Have fun!
